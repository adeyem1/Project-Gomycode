          <h1>Early life and ancestry</h1>
          <p>Michelle LaVaughn Robinson was born on January 17, 1964, in Chicago, Illinois, to Fraser Robinson III (1935–1991),[5] a city water plant employee and Democratic precinct captain, and Marian Shields Robinson (b. July 30, 1937), a secretary at Spiegel's catalog store.[6] Her mother was a full-time homemaker until Michelle entered high school.[7] <p> 

             <p> The Robinson and Shields families trace their roots to pre-Civil War African Americans in the American South.[5] On her father's side, she is descended from the Gullah people of South Carolina's Lowcountry region.[8] Her paternal great-great grandfather, Jim Robinson, was born into slavery in 1850 on Friendfield Plantation, near Georgetown, South Carolina.[9][10] He became a freedman at age 15 after the war. Some of Obama's paternal family still reside in the Georgetown area.[11][12] Her grandfather Fraser Robinson, Jr., built his own house in South Carolina. He and his wife LaVaughn (née Johnson) returned to the Lowcountry from Chicago after retirement.[9] <p> 
            
             <p> Among her maternal ancestors was her great-great-great-grandmother, Melvinia Dosey Shields,[13] born into slavery in South Carolina but sold to Henry Walls Shields, who had a 200-acre farm in Clayton County, Georgia, near Atlanta. Melvinia's first son, Adolphus T. Shields, was biracial and born into slavery around 1860. Based on DNA and other evidence, in 2012 researchers said his father was likely 20-year-old Charles Marion Shields, son of Melvinia's master. They may have had a continuing relationship, as she had two more mixed-race children and lived near Shields after emancipation, taking his surname (she later changed her surname).[14] <p> 
            
             <p> As was often the case, Melvinia did not talk to relatives about Dolphus's father.[15] Dolphus Shields, with his wife Alice, moved to Birmingham, Alabama, after the Civil War. They were great-great-grandparents of Robinson, whose grandparents had moved to Chicago.[15] Other of their children's lines migrated to Cleveland, Ohio, in the 20th century.[14] <p> 
            
            <p> <p> </p>All four of Robinson's grandparents had multiracial ancestors, reflecting the complex history of the U.S. Her extended family has said that people did not talk about the era of slavery when they were growing up.[14] Her distant ancestry includes Irish, English, and Native American roots.[16] Among her contemporary extended family is Rabbi Capers Funnye; born in Georgetown, South Carolina. Funnye is the son of her grandfather Robinson's sister and her husband, and he is about 12 years older than Michelle. Funnye converted to Judaism after college. He is a paternal first cousin once-removed.[17][18]<p> <p> </p>
            
            <p> <p> </p>Robinson's childhood home was on the upper floor of 7436 South Euclid Avenue in Chicago's South Shore community area, which her parents rented from her great-aunt, who had the first floor.[6][19][20][21] She was raised in what she describes as a "conventional" home, with "the mother at home, the father works, you have dinner around the table".[22] Her elementary school was down the street. She and her family enjoyed playing games such as Monopoly, reading, and frequently saw extended family on both sides.[23] She played piano,[24] learning from her great-aunt, who was a piano teacher.[25] The Robinsons attended services at nearby South Shore United Methodist Church.[19] They used to vacation in a rustic cabin in White Cloud, Michigan.[19] She and her 21-month-older brother, Craig, skipped the second grade.[6][26]<p> <p> </p>
            
            <p>Her father suffered from multiple sclerosis, which had a profound effect on her. Subsequently, she was determined to stay out of trouble and perform well in school.[27] By sixth grade, Michelle joined a gifted class at Bryn Mawr Elementary School (later renamed Bouchet Academy).[28] She attended Whitney Young High School,[29] Chicago's first magnet high school, established as a selective enrollment school, where she was a classmate of Jesse Jackson's daughter Santita.[23] The round-trip commute from the Robinsons' South Side home to the Near West Side, where the school was located, took three hours.[30] Michelle recalled being fearful of how others would perceive her, but disregarded any negativity around her and used it "to fuel me, to keep me going".[31][32] She recalled facing gender discrimination growing up, saying, for example, that rather than asking her for her opinion on a given subject, people commonly tended to ask what her older brother thought.[33] She was on the honor roll for four years, took advanced placement classes, was a member of the National Honor Society, and served as student council treasurer.[6] She graduated in 1981 as the salutatorian of her class.[30]

                  <p>Michelle's mother Marian Robinson, was a stay-at-home mother.[56] Her father was Fraser C. Robinson III, who worked at the city's water purification plant.[56] Robinson's father, Fraser, died from complications from his illness in March 1991.[57] She would later say that although he was the "hole in my heart" and "loss in my scar", the memory of her father has motivated her each day since.[42] Her friend Suzanne Alele died from cancer around this time as well. These losses made her think of her contributions toward society and how well she was influencing the world from her law firm, in her first job after law school. She considered this a turning point.[58]</p>

                  <p>Robinson met Barack Obama when they were among the few African Americans at their law firm, Sidley Austin LLP (she has sometimes said only two, although others have noted that there were others in different departments).[59] She was assigned to mentor him while he was a summer associate.[60] Their relationship started with a business lunch and then a community organization meeting where he first impressed her.[61]</p>

                  <p>Before meeting Obama, Michelle had told her mother she intended to focus solely on her career.[62] The couple's first date was to Spike Lee's movie Do the Right Thing (1989).[63] Barack Obama has said the couple had an "opposites attract" scenario in their initial interest in each other, since Michelle had stability from her two-parent home while he was "adventurous".[64] They married on October 3, 1992.[61] After suffering a miscarriage, Michelle underwent in vitro fertilisation[65] to conceive their daughters Malia Ann (born 1998) and Natasha (known as Sasha, born 2001).[66]</p>

                  <p>Following law school, Obama became an associate at the Chicago office of the law firm Sidley & Austin, where she met her future husband Barack. At the firm, she worked on marketing and intellectual property law.[6] She continues to hold her law license, but as she no longer needs it for her work, she has kept it on a voluntary inactive status since 1993.[79][80]
                  </p>
                  <p>In 1991, she held public sector positions in the Chicago city government as an Assistant to the Mayor, and as Assistant Commissioner of Planning and Development. In 1993, she became executive director for the Chicago office of Public Allies, a non-profit organization encouraging young people to work on social issues in nonprofit groups and government agencies.[29] She worked there nearly four years and set fundraising records for the organization that still stood twelve years after she had left.[23] Obama later said she had never been happier in her life prior to working "to build Public Allies".[81]</p>
                  <p>In 1996, Obama served as the Associate Dean of Student Services at the University of Chicago, where she developed the university's Community Service Center.[82] In 2002, she began working for the University of Chicago Hospitals, first as executive director for community affairs and, beginning May 2005, as vice president for Community and External Affairs.[83]</p>
